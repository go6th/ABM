# Project status

Updated 2026-10-02.

## Workflow v1

Status: partial scaffold. `config/workflow_v1.yaml` defines the 13 research stages
and dependencies; the core contracts and deterministic tests are in
`src/account_intelligence/workflow/` and `tests/workflow/`.

### Implemented and locally verified

- Workflow specification parsing, cycle/ownership checks, and sequential LangGraph
  construction.
- Small checkpoint state, starter-shape migration checks, and reducers for references,
  counters, completion markers, and loop outcomes.
- Coverage statuses with required proof, lifecycle transition table, and evidence
  source/quote/URL/figure checks.
- Workflow-specific Ruff and strict mypy; seven workflow tests; skill asset validation;
  migration lint.

### Not implemented

Production stage handlers, data repositories, provider and model adapters, persisted
workflow checkpoints for this graph, end-to-end slice runner, production builder and
gate adapters, and wallet settlement. Missing adapters must not be represented as
successful work; the stage base raises `NotConfigured`.

### Decisions and source gaps

- P2.15 owner `pass1_relationship` confirmed by the user on 2026-10-02.
- Original PRD Appendix A is absent from `docs/sources/`; all other inferred checklist
  ownership is provisional and annotated in `docs/workflow/stage-map.md`.
- Soft budget shares and unsourced source-specific loop caps are provisional config.
- Wallet reserve is in credits while the workflow budget is USD. D-04 must settle the
  wallet accounting unit and conversion before finalization can be implemented safely.
- A distinct judge profile remains TODO because the active model config uses one
  profile for synthesis and verification.
- Postgres-backed isolation, settlement, replay guarantees and full integration remain
  unverified; the local PostgreSQL service was unavailable.
